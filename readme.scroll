# codeduel.org

* I wish I had heard of this site! - Alexander Hamilton

* Dueling is illegal in the United States but sometimes you really just want to challenge somebody.
* In CodeDuel.org you challenge an opponent to a one hour open source hackathon where you both contribute to the project(s) of your choice.
* This is a lot safer than the old way and everyone's a winner (except for the loser).
